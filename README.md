Wavelength
==========

Wavelength is a visually driven social interpretation game about placing ideas along a smooth spectrum between two opposing concepts (e.g., Soft 9 Hard, Ugly 9 Beautiful, Simple 9 Complex).

Each round presents a single clue 7 typically a word or short phrase 7 at the top of a dark, minimalist interface. Players adjust a brightly colored needle along a semi9circular gauge to indicate where they think the clue belongs between the two extremes.

After a selection is locked in, the dial reveals a layered, color9coded scoring system centered on a hidden target position. Inner zones award more points, outer zones fewer, so players can instantly see how close they were.

The digital design emphasizes:

- A continuous gradient instead of hard category boundaries
- Strong contrast, smooth color transitions, and simple typography
- Motion and color as primary feedback for accuracy
- Adjustable target widths and varied spectrum pairings for difficulty and replayability

This repo will contain a sleek, visually focused implementation of Wavelength that blends psychology, interpretation, and visual clarity to turn subjective opinions into measurable, shareable results.
